## Polynomial Regression from Scratch
This repository presents a clean and complete implementation of Polynomial Regression using only core Python libraries. Unlike typical implementations using high-level
machine learning frameworks, this project builds the model from scratch, offering deeper insights into the underlying mathematics and optimization process.

📌 Project Summary
Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent 
variable and dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. This project:

- Loads and visualizes custom training data
- Manually generates polynomial features
- Applies normalization
- Trains the model using gradient descent
- Plots the predicted results and cost function

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Only standard Python libraries are employed:

- numpy for numerical computations  
- pandasfor data handling  
- matplotlib for data visualization
