# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

This project presents a complete implementation of a multi-layer feedforward neural networkusing only core Python libraries. The network is trained to perform binary classification without using any machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

 üìå Project Overview

The notebook builds a fully connected neural network with:
- 1 Input Layer
- 3 Hidden Layers
- 1 Output Layer

It uses the sigmoid activation function, forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent to learn from data. All components of the training process are built from the ground up, making this an ideal resource for learning how deep learning works under the hood.
